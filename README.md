Project Summary

This project aims to develop a volunteer management system with a user-friendly front-end for volunteers and administrators. Key components include user registration and profile management, allowing volunteers to register with basic information and complete their profiles with detailed personal and availability data. Administrators can create and manage events, match volunteers to events based on skills and availability, and utilize a notification system for updates and reminders. The system also provides a volunteer history feature to track participation, ensuring efficient and effective volunteer coordination. The front-end components ensure comprehensive form validations for all required fields.
